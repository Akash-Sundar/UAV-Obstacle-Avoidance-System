# UAV-Obstacle-Avoidance-System
The dynamics of a UAV was controlled using a PD controller and its path through the obstacle course was generated using Dijkstra and A* algorithms. 
A trajectory planner was impleneted to combine the outputs of the controller and the motion planner and provide a smooth transition of system dynamics using minimum snap trajectory.
